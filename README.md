## Future Improvements
All mandatory test requirements have been developed. However, there are some points that I couldn't implement due to time constraints.

- User feedback: personalize messages for each action
- Add loading effect: when switching screens and actions
- Refactoring: divide more object responsibilities
- Add unit tests
